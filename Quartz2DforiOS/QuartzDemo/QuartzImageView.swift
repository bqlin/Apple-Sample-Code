        // puts the origin in the upper-left corner. For the sake of brevity (and because
        // it likely would go unnoticed for the image used) this is not addressed here.
        // For the demonstration of PDF drawing however, it is addressed, as it would definitely
        // be noticed, and one method of addressing it is shown there.

        // CGContextDrawTiledImage() will fill the entire clipping area with the image, so to avoid
        // filling the entire view, we'll clip the view to the rect below inset by 20%. This rect extends
        // past the region of the view, but since the view's rectangle has already been applied as a clip
        // to our drawing area, it will be intersected with this rect to form the final clipping area

        // The origin of the image rect works similarly to the phase parameter for SetLineDash and
        // SetPatternPhase and specifies where in the coordinate system the "first" image is drawn.
