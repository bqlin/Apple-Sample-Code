    Abstract:
    The SequencerViewController class provides specific UI Elements to interact with the AVAudioSequencer object. The sequencer is not directly part of AVAudioEngine.
     
                    UISlider *sequencerPlaybackRateSlider;  Set the playback rate for the sequencer
                    UISlider *sequencerPositionSlider;      Set the current position for the current track
                    UIButton *sequencerPlayButton;          Toggle the state of the sequencer
