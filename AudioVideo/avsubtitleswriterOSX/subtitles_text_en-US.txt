 Abstract: This is an example subtitles file used by the SubtitlesTextReader class. The options that can be set for the track are language, extended language, and characteristics. SDH is the only supported characteristic. Time ranges are formatted as xx:xx:xx,xxx â€”-> xx:xx:xx,xxx specifying when the subtitles should be shown. Optionally, on the next line, subtitle text can be provided. A time range followed by !!! on the same line signifies a forced subtitle. The time ranges need to included the empty time between subtitles text, hence the time ranges with no subtitle text.
