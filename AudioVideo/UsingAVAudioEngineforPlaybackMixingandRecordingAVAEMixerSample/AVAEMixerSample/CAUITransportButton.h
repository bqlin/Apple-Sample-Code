 Abstract:
 This UIButton subclass programatically draws a transport button with a particular drawing style.
         It features a fill color that can be an accent color.
         If the button has the recordEnabledButtonStyle, it pulses on and off.
  
         These buttons resize themselves dynamically at runtime so that their bounds is a minimum of 44 x 44 pts
         in order to make them easy to press.
         The button image will draw at the original size specified in the storyboard
