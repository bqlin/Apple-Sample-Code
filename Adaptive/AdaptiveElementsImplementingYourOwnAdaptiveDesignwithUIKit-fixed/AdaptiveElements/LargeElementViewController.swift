	Abstract:
	LargeElementViewController is used in two different ways:
	 1. Contained within ExampleContainerViewController, when its width is large.
	 2. Presented by SmallElementViewController, when the ExampleContainerViewController's width is small.
	 It shows a large version of the element. When it is presented, tapping on it will dismiss it.
