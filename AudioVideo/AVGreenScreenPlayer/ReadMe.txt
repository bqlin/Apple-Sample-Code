### AVGreenScreenPlayer ###

===========================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

This OS X sample application demonstrates real-time video processing, specifically chroma key-effect, using AVPlayerItemVideoOutput. It uses AVPlayerItemVideoOutput in combination with a custom CIFilter to do basic chroma keying. The sample demonstrates the use of CVDisplayLink to drive AVPlayerItemVideoOutput to vend pixel buffers and also AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer to display the processed buffers. The user can input color using the color well and this color is used for the chroma key effect through a CIFilter which is added as a filter to the AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer.

===========================================================================
USING THE APP:

Launch the app and you will be prompted to open an existing video file to perform the custom video processing. You can open additional video files using the File->Open menu item.

Click the color well to select a color to use for the chroma key effect.

Press the Play button to play the movie and the chroma key effect is applied during playback.
