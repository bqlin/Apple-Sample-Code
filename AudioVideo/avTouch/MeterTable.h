// MeterTable constructor arguments: 
// inNumUISteps - the number of steps in the UI element that will be drawn. 
//					This could be a height in pixels or number of bars in an LED style display.
// inTableSize - The size of the table. The table needs to be large enough that there are no large gaps in the response.
// inMinDecibels - the decibel value of the minimum displayed amplitude.
// inRoot - this controls the curvature of the response. 2.0 is square root, 3.0 is cube root. But inRoot doesn't have to be integer valued, it could be 1.8 or 2.5, etc.
