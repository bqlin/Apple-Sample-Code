AVMediaSelectionDemo
====================

This sample demonstrates how to select different media selection options like closed captions, subtitles and audio language options on different player items. This sample sets up four views each handling their own AVPlayer and AVPlayerItems. A user can select an option through the contextual pop up menu, which in turn gets set on the corresponding AVPlayerItem.
